Game Ideas
o Rez meets Musis
collect multiple items at once; they activate when released
items have musical effects; notes, effects, rythms, instruments etc
items also have corresponding visual effects
maybe parameterise most items and they get given random values, for variety
o Monkey Zorb Balls
You are inside the monkey ball, and must tilt your head to make the ball roll
