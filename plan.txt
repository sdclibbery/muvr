 webvr does not support my phone, which would need google vr services installed, but it cant
? Can you stop the screensaver kicking in?
 Ish: https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js
? What's the dev feedback loop like?
 game: edit, reload browser page; debug with web inspector
 vr: edit, publish, reload phone browser
? Can the vr/rendering be run on a thread?

? Can the audio be run on a thread?
 Should be able to do waveform generation in a web worker, but all actual AudioContext usage has to be on main thread

? What is the vr latency/jitter like?
? What is the audio latency/jitter like?
? Could it interface with an external gyro (eg yocto 3d)?

platform: android
? What's the dev feedback loop like? How good is the emulator for this?
? What's the audio synthesis situation like on android? JSyn?
? Do we need native code for audio and/or vr rendering?

Web Prototype for basic VR
x Basic webgl
x Respond webgl to screen size change properly
x fullscreen
x 2 viewport vr rendering
 x Draw same view into two viewports
 x Distinct projections for each viewport to give 3D
x Look up and down - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Detecting_device_orientation
x Support full 3D view using quaternions for laptop
x Yaw should be relative (zeroed) to starting yaw
x Roll flips sign when pitched upwards..?
x Look left and right using tilt on phone
x Should switch based on user agent not 'phone in landscape mode'
x Correct on phone in landscape
x Stop the screensaver: https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js
x Phone magically not broken
x Stay awake not working because the video 'play' must come from a user interaction; suggest we trigger it on the fullscreen toggle
o Try running audio synth at the same time
o Try rendering on a thread

Game Ideas
o Rez meets Musis
collect multiple items at once; they activate when released
items have musical effects; notes, effects, rythms, instruments etc
items also have corresponding visual effects
maybe parameterise most items and they get given random values, for variety
o Monkey Zorb Balls
You are inside the monkey ball, and must tilt your head to make the ball roll
