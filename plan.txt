Web Prototype for basic VR
x Basic webgl
x Respond webgl to screen size change properly
x fullscreen
x 2 viewport vr rendering
 x Draw same view into two viewports
 x Distinct projections for each viewport to give 3D
o Look up and down - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Detecting_device_orientation
o Support full 3D view using quaternions
o Look left and right
o Look left and right using tilt if no yaw available
? clever offset proj matrix..??

Game Ideas
o Rez meets Musis
collect multiple items at once; they activate when released
items have musical effects; notes, effects, rythms, instruments etc
items also have corresponding visual effects
maybe parameterise most items and they get given random values, for variety
o Monkey Zorb Balls
You are inside the monkey ball, and must tilt your head to make the ball roll
